# txt.e1e1e1.net

txt takes plain text, compresses it into a URL fragment, and provides a link that can be shared. When it is opened, it inflates that data on the receiver's side.

txt is inspired by [itty.bitty.site](https://github.com/alcor/itty-bitty), but strips down many of its features to imitate plain text rather than HTML.
